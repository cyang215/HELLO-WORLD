# HELLO-WORLD
Hi Visitor!

If you don't know me, my name is Chen. I live in Boston. From 2016 to now (January 2021), I work in big4 (public accounting firm) and I am a CPA. I started teaching myself programming in 2017. I learned a little bit of Python at that time. I took Harvard's CS50 as my intro class to CS. I did not finish CS50 untill 2020 when I had more time at home due to the Pandemic. After finished CS50, I got really interested in computer science. The logic behind codes is beautiful. I went on taking Berkeley's cs61b and finished some really cool projects. I wanted to have my projects available on internet and figured Github will be a good place. I created this readme file to experiment some basic (and important!) Github functions.

Welcome to my place and hope you enjoyed reading my story!
